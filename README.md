# Gmail-OTP-Sender
To set up and run the project, the first step is to configure the backend by running the **`otp-server.js`** file, which acts as the server. Before proceeding, ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your laptop or PC. You can verify this by opening the Command Prompt (cmd) and typing `node --version` and `npm --version`. If the versions are displayed, it means Node.js and npm are properly installed; otherwise, download and install Node.js from its official website. Next, open the project in Visual Studio Code, where youâ€™ll need to install three essential dependencies: **express** (for building the server), **nodemailer** (for sending emails like OTPs), and **body-parser** (for processing data sent from the frontend). To install these, open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and type `npm install express nodemailer body-parser`. Once the dependencies are installed, navigate to the location of the **`otp-server.js`** file in the terminal and run it using the command `node otp-server.js`. This will start the backend server, enabling it to handle requests and send OTPs. Make sure these steps are completed to ensure the project runs successfully.
